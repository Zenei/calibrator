# Calibrator
This is a module in a much bigger project dealing with data from gateways of  Automated Weather Stations in East Africa.

## Installation
This does not need installation. Cloning or downloading the repository is enough.

## Running
Attempting to run this without access to required weather data will not yield the desired results.

## Errors
Any existing errors if any will be worked on in time.

## Updates
There is a plan to make the files object-oriented in the future.
