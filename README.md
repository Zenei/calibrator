# Calibrator
This is a module in a much bigger project dealing with data from gateways of  Automated Weather Stations in East Africa. It's purpose is to compare data collected manually with data received from automatically via gateways from weather stations. Manually collected data is considered accurate, since it does not suffer from signal interferance among other things. Hence calibrations are done based on the manual data.

## Installation
This does not need installation. Cloning or downloading the repository is enough.

## Running
Attempting to run this without access to required weather data will not yield the desired results.

## Errors
Any existing errors if any will be worked on in time.

## Updates
There is a plan to make the files object-oriented in the future.
